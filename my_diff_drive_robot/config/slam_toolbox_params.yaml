    ###########################
    # General ROS Settings
    ###########################
    use_sim_time: true         # Whether to use simulation time (Gazebo). Set to false on a real robot
    base_frame: "base_link"    # Your robotâ€™s base frame
    odom_frame: "odom"         # The frame where odometry is published
    map_frame: "map"           # The root frame for the SLAM Toolbox

    # (Optional) If your laser scan topic is different, set it here.
    scan_topic: "scan"

    # This sets how frequently the map is published or updated, in seconds.
    map_update_interval: 3.0

    # The minimum distance to consider movement valid in the map, in meters
    # (helps filter out minor "noisy" motion).
    minimum_travel_distance: 0.2

    # Whether to publish the occupancy grid via /map topic.
    # Typically "true" for live SLAM.
    publish_map: true

    ##################################
    # Mode: (online_async or online_sync)
    ##################################
    # Slam Toolbox has two primary online modes: asynchronous or synchronous.
    # - "online_async" is typically recommended for a continuous mapping experience
    # - "online_sync" can be used if you want to process scans in synchronous callbacks

    mode: "mapping"  # For "online_async_launch.py", you usually want "mapping" 
                     # If "localization", it would try to localize on an existing map.

    ###########################
    # Kinematic Settings
    ###########################
    # If your robot can rotate in place, set to true (differential drive).
    # If you have a car-like robot (Ackermann steering), set to false.
    # This helps with how the SLAM solver interprets motion.
    allow_unknown_initial_pose: true

    ###########################
    # Solver/Optimizer Settings
    ###########################
    # This sets the plugin used for scan matching and optimization.
    # "plugin" can be:
    #    - "Karto" (classic approach),
    #    - "G2O" (graph-based approach),
    #    - or others. Karto is a common default.

    solver_plugins:
      - solver_type: "Karto"

    # The number of iterations the solver performs every update.
    optimization_iterations: 10

    # Adjust thresholds for how "good" a loop closure or scan match must be.
    resolution: 0.05    # resolution of the map in meters/pixel
    max_laser_range: 8.0
    min_laser_range: 0.2

    ###########################
    # Scan Matching Parameters
    ###########################
    # How big the correlative scan matching window is in (x, y, theta).
    # Larger windows are more robust but more computationally heavy.
    correlation_search_space_pose: 0.3      # translational window in meters
    correlation_search_space_angle: 0.2     # rotational window in radians
    loop_search_space_pose: 0.5
    loop_search_space_angle: 0.2

    # Thresholds for how close a scan match must be to consider it valid.
    # Lower thresholds require near-perfect matches; higher thresholds allow more drift but can accept more closures.
    loop_match_min_response: 0.3
    scan_match_min_response_normal: 0.8

    ###########################
    # Loop Closure Settings
    ###########################
    # Attempt loop closures at specified intervals (in meters or time).
    # Setting these too high or too low can affect performance.
    loop_closure_enabled: true
    loop_closure_detect_radius: 1.0   # meters

    # If you want to always have a large window for loop closures, this can be helpful for large maps.
    map_file_name: ""  # If left empty, no map is loaded at start (online mapping).
                       # If you wanted to load a prior map, you'd specify it here.

    ###########################
    # Lifecycle & Serialization
    ###########################
    # Slam Toolbox can serialize data so you can pause and resume sessions or load older maps.
    serialization_enabled: false
    # If true, will write .posegraph files to disk on shutdown (for advanced usage).

    ###########################
    # Localization Settings (Optional)
    ###########################
    # If you switch your mode to "localization", some of these matter more.
    use_scan_matching: true
    use_loop_closure: true
    # Add parameters for AMCL-like behavior if needed, see the SLAM Toolbox wiki.

    ###########################
    # Visualizations
    ###########################
    # If you'd like to visualize the graph or constraints in RViz, you can enable these.
    use_rviz: true

    ###########################
    # Debug / Logging
    ###########################
    # Output debug info, help diagnose scan match performance, etc.
    enable_scan_diagnostics: false
    # Logging level: can be debug, info, warn, error, etc.
    # (In ROS 2, typically set via CLI or environment variable.)
