# README.md: Running Nav2 Navigation with YDLidar, micro-ROS, and Cartographer SLAM

This document explains how to run a ROS2 Nav2 navigation stack using YDLidar for laser scanning, micro-ROS for robot base communication via serial, and Cartographer for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).  You will need to open **five** terminals to launch all the necessary components.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **ROS2 Humble (or your ROS2 distribution) installed and sourced.**
*   **Required ROS2 Packages Installed:**
    *   `ydlidar_ros2_driver`
    *   `micro_ros_agent`
    *   `cartographer_ros`
    *   `nav2_bringup`
    *   `rviz2`
    You can install these using `apt install ros-humble-<package_name>` (adjust `humble` if needed).
*   **YDLidar Sensor Connected and Serial Port Identified:** Know the serial port your YDLidar is connected to (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB1`).
*   **micro-ROS Firmware on Robot Base:** Your robot's microcontroller should be running micro-ROS firmware configured for serial communication at the specified baud rate.
*   **`my_diff_drive_robot` Package (or your equivalent):** You should have a ROS2 package (named `my_diff_drive_robot` in this example) that contains:
    *   Your `cartographer.launch.py` file.
    *   Potentially, custom Nav2 parameter files if needed.
    *   Adjust the package name in the commands below if yours is different.

## Launch Instructions (Open 5 Terminals)

### Terminal 1: Launch YDLidar Driver

This terminal starts the ROS2 driver for your YDLidar sensor, publishing laser scan data.

```bash
ros2 launch ydlidar_ros2_driver ydlidar_launch.py
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ros2 launch`:  Launches ROS2 launch files.
*   `ydlidar_ros2_driver`:  The ROS2 package for the YDLidar driver.
*   `ydlidar_launch.py`:  The launch file within the `ydlidar_ros2_driver` package.

### Terminal 2: Run micro-ROS Agent

Run the micro-ROS agent to bridge ROS2 with your robot base over serial. **Adjust `/dev/ttyUSB1` and `115200` to match your setup.**

```bash
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyUSB1 -b 115200
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ros2 run`: Runs a ROS2 executable.
*   `micro_ros_agent`: The ROS2 package for the micro-ROS agent.
*   `micro_ros_agent serial`:  Executes the serial communication agent.
*   `--dev /dev/ttyUSB1`:  Specifies the serial port. **Replace `/dev/ttyUSB1` with your actual serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`).**
*   `-b 115200`: Sets the baud rate. **Ensure this matches your micro-ROS device's baud rate.**

### Terminal 3: Launch Cartographer SLAM

Launch Cartographer SLAM to build a map and estimate robot pose using lidar and potentially odometry. **Ensure `my_diff_drive_robot` matches your package name.**

```bash
ros2 launch my_diff_drive_robot cartographer.launch.py
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ros2 launch`:  Launches ROS2 launch files.
*   `my_diff_drive_robot`:  **Replace with your ROS2 package name** containing `cartographer.launch.py`.
*   `cartographer.launch.py`:  The launch file for Cartographer SLAM configuration.

### Terminal 4: Launch Nav2 Navigation

Launch the Nav2 navigation stack for autonomous robot navigation. **`use_sim_time:=False` is crucial for real hardware.**

```bash
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py use_sim_time:=False
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ros2 launch`:  Launches ROS2 launch files.
*   `nav2_bringup`:  The ROS2 package for Nav2 bringup.
*   `navigation_launch.py`:  The main Nav2 launch file.
*   `use_sim_time:=False`:  Sets `use_sim_time` to `False` for real-world time synchronization with hardware.

### Terminal 5: Run RViz2 for Visualization

Launch RViz2 to visualize the map, robot pose, laser scans, and navigation data.

```bash
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d /opt/ros/humble/share/nav2_bringup/rviz/nav2_default_view.rviz
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ros2 run`: Runs a ROS2 executable.
*   `rviz2`: The ROS2 package for RViz2.
*   `rviz2`: The RViz2 executable.
*   `-d /opt/ros/humble/share/nav2_bringup/rviz/nav2_default_view.rviz`:  Loads the Nav2 default RViz configuration. **Adjust `/opt/ros/humble` if using a different ROS2 distribution.**

## Important Notes and Troubleshooting

*   **ROS2 Environment:**  **Remember to source your ROS2 environment in each terminal** before running these commands (e.g., `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`).
*   **Package Installation:** Verify all required packages are installed. Use `apt install ros-humble-<package_name>` to install missing packages.
*   **Serial Port Permissions:**  You may need to adjust serial port permissions. Try adding your user to the `dialout` group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` and then log out/reboot.
*   **Serial Port and Baud Rate:** Double-check that `/dev/ttyUSB1` and `115200` in the micro-ROS agent command are correct for your robot base.
*   **`my_diff_drive_robot` Package:** Ensure your `cartographer.launch.py` and potentially Nav2 configurations are in your ROS2 package (adjust package name if needed).
*   **Cartographer and Nav2 Configuration:** Review and customize `cartographer.launch.py` and Nav2 parameter files for your robot's specific characteristics and environment.
*   **Map Building:** After launching, manually drive your robot around the environment to allow Cartographer to build a map.
*   **Navigation:** Once a map is generated, you can use Nav2 to set navigation goals and test autonomous navigation. Use tools like `nav2_simple_navigator` or send goals through RViz2.
*   **RViz2 Verification:** In RViz2, confirm you see:
    *   Laser scans from YDLidar.
    *   The map being built by Cartographer.
    *   Robot pose estimation.
    *   Navigation related visualizations once Nav2 is active.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run a ROS2 Nav2 navigation system with YDLidar, micro-ROS, and Cartographer SLAM.  For more advanced configurations or troubleshooting, refer to the documentation for each individual ROS2 package (ydlidar\_ros2\_driver, micro\_ros\_agent, cartographer\_ros, nav2\_bringup).
